# 🐉 Wyrmquest

**Wyrmquest** is a browser-based RPG engine built for expressive worldbuilding, modular architecture, and mythic gameplay. Players explore a tile-based map, engage in combat, gather loot, and shape the world through progression and choices. Designed with clarity, scalability, and lore-driven logic at its core.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

- **Modular Everything**: From combat to UI, each system is built to be isolated, scalable, and expressive.
- **Lore-Driven Logic**: Every mechanic reflects the mythic tone of the world—progression, visuals, and feedback are narrative tools.
- **Player-Centric Systems**: Stats, inventory, and upgrades are designed to empower players and reflect their journey.
- **Future-Proof Architecture**: Razor layouts, CSS separation, and single-responsibility services ensure maintainability and clarity.

## 🗺️ World Overview

- **Town**: Central hub for upgrades, shops, and respawning. Evolves based on player achievements.
- **Valley**: Early exploration zone with enemy encounters and loot drops.
- **Church**: Stat upgrades via XP.
- **Graveyard**: Respawn location with potential lore hooks.
- **Shops**: Item buying/selling, eventually split into weapon and armor vendors.

## 📦 Planned Systems

- Combat log with readable feedback
- Inventory decay and global item visibility
- Equipment slots and stat modifiers
- Flag-based progression and achievement tracking
- Multiplayer boss events and shared tile logic

## 🧙‍♂️ Credits

Created by **Chris Bodirsky**, a mythic systems architect with a passion for modular design, expressive logic, and lore-driven gameplay. Wyrmquest is a living engine—refactored, expanded, and future-proofed with every commit.
Inspired by Shiva Online. Which makes me sound crazy because you won't find it documented anywhere. But it was a browser game that became defunct in the late 1990s or early 2000s. Before the wayback machine and not very popular.
So I absolutely promise it was a thing. I'm absolutely not making up a whole browser MMORPG. But I shouldn't say anything because I'm stealing ideas from it and I can act like it's all my ideas.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repo, run the project, and explore the valley. The wyrm stirs beneath the tiles.
